# p1-2 Strings Practice

Create new NetBeans projects as you deem necessary to complete the exercises below. Ensure that all new NetBeans projects are created inside the same directory where this repository was cloned.

(1) Write a program that inputs a line of text and then outputs the line twice: once in uppercase letters, and once in lowercase. Output the character that is at index 4 of the string. Output the index of the letter "m" in the string. Output the length of the string.
```
Type a string:          Barney is my hero.
Uppercase:              BARNEY IS MY HERO.
Lowercase:              barney is my hero.
Character at index 4:   e
Index of m:             10
Length of string:       18
```

(2) Write a program that inputs a line of text and a search character. Output the number of occurrences of the search character in the line of text.

(3) Write a program that declares a string with the value: ```Let's do lunch.```
Print the string backwards: ```.hcnul od s'teL```
Print only the first word in the string: ```Let's```
Adjust your program to accept user input and perform these two tasks on the input string.

(4) Write a program to input a 10-digit number. If the user types more or fewer than 10 digits, ask them to try again. From the number they have entered, extract the 3-digit "area code", the 3-digit "exchange" and the remaining 4-digit number as separate strings. Print these values individually. Print the entire phone number in the usual format:
```
Enter a 10-digit telephone number: 212925613
Too short. Try again.
Enter a 10-digit telephone number: 21292561348
Too long. Try again.
Enter a 10-digit telephone number: 2129256134
The area code is: 212
The exchange is: 925
The number is: 6134
The phone number is: 212-925-6134
```

(5) Write a program that inputs a person's name in the form *First Middle Last* and then print it in the form *Last, First M.* where *"M."* is the person's middle initial. For example, the input "George Bernard Lacostenata" would produce the output "Lacostenata, George B."

(6) Write a program that capitalizes a two-word name. For example, the input "nORth CaRolINa" would produce the output "North Carolina".

(7) Write a program that inputs a word and checks to see if it is a palindrome.  For example,
 * The input "729151927" would produce the output "This is a palindrome." 
 * The input "Radar" would produce the output "This is a palindrome." 
 * The input "Madam, I'm Adam" would produce the output "This is not a palindrome" because of the asymmetrical punctuation.
 
(8) Write a program that asks for a word as input. After a word has been entered, output the word with it's vowels removed.  For example, the input "Mississippi" would produce the output "Msssspp". The input "Coca-Cola" would produce "Cc-Cl".

(9) Write a program that inputs a number of words. The first word entered is the sentinal name that will also be used to indicate the end of the list. Then output the (alphabetically) last word. For Example:
```
Type the sentinal name: Barney
Enter the list of words:
Brick
donut
Mug
paper
tape
bin
eraser
barney
Alphabetically, the last word is: tape
```

(10) Write a program that allows the user to enter a line of text. Output the number of tokens in the line. Then the text is output one word to a line. For example:
```
Enter a line of text:
It's nice to just put my feet up.
Number of tokens: 8
The tokens are:
It's 
nice 
to 
just 
put 
my 
feet 
up.
```

(11) Write a program that eliminates the punctuation from an input string. In other words, remove the following characters: **,.:;'?!()\"**
